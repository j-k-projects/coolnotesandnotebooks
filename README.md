# A Collection of Cool Notes and Notebooks

This repository serves as a place to collect interesting notes, Jupyter Notebooks, and other resources that may be useful, interesting, or fun.

## Notebooks

Jupyter Notebooks are found in the "Notebooks" folder. The standalone `.ipynb` files can be opened in NBviewer or used interactively using Binder.

## Notes

A variety of notes can be found in the "Notes" folder which contains a collection of markdown files. These notes are composed of random thoughts, code snippets, interesting reading, and some scratch pads for random work on projects.

## Stata

I use `Stata` for almost all of my projects. The "Stata" folder is a collection of various Stata code snippets, `.do` files, or useful content for performing data analysis in Stata.

## Varia

The "Varia" folder is a bit of a "junk drawer" to place miscellaneous or random content in. Who _really_ knows what is in there, or if it will ever be useful again.
